# 2021-interactive-heat-map

*An explorative approach for interactive heat-maps, using data during swiss heat-wave in 2019, based solely on python.*  

This project was done as a seminar work for "Seminar Geodata Analysis and Modelling" at the University of Bern, 
during the spring semester of 2021.

The data consist of [NetAtmo citizen weather stations (CWS)](https://weathermap.netatmo.com/).

## Contact Data
Name: Brian Schweigler  
E-Mail: brian.schweigler@students.unibe.ch

## Objectives
-[X] Display CWS  on geospatial map.
-[X] Display relevant (meta-) information on-click of points.
-[ ] Optional: *Animate* data / maps.

## Nice to have:
-[X] Visually appealing display of information.
-[X] Further interactivity (Zoom / Mouse-Over).
-[ ] Interpolation with additional information.

## Project Approach
Primarily, I focused on a minimal working representation of the CWS on a map of Berne.  
From there I went on to include a larger data set.
Next step was finding a way to make the points and map interactable.
Here I migrate from the standard plotting functions to Bokeh, after trying several alternatives.
Bokeh was the easiest to work with and seemed the most flexible in also accomodating GeoData.
Nonetheless, the dataframe had to be adjusted to be imported into Bokeh.

Furthermore, the supervisors had the suggestion of not only making the map interactable, 
but also implementing a way to navigate between time-steps. 
In theory, this sounds feasible, but when dealing with python code, it can not be dynamically recompiled in the browser.
To connect real python callbacks to user events (like clicks), there has to be an actual Python process running to execute the callback code. 
That process could be handled by a Bokeh server (or native javascript), but that is outside the scope of this seminar project and would deviate from the native python focus.
With javacsript, there are variants to do everything in the browser

## Result
TODO

## Project Requirements
- Python 3.X (Tested on 3.9)
- Bokeh
- Numpy

## Improvements
If one had enough time, there is always a lot to be improved and iterated upon.  
To stay within the frame of the lecture, the following improvements were left out:
- **Higher Resolution of points temperature differences (using more color shades).**  
  Left out as three colors are sufficient for a PoC.
- **Alternatives to OpenStreetMap.**  
  Left out as it would only change the underlying map, but not the interactivity.
- **Fine-tuning of parameters, e.g. point size through a widget.**  
  May be interesting, but leads to visual clutter and is not the intent.
- **Larger time-frame than just a few hours in the nights of 26th to 27th of June 2019.**  
  While this is definitely doable, in the project this was based on, we only focused on that specific night, 
  as the decision-maker Stadtgr√ºn Bern focused on that.
