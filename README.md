# 2021-interactive-heat-map

An approach for interactive heat-maps, using data from heat-wave in 2019 using python packages. 
This data consist of [NetAtmo weather stations](https://weathermap.netatmo.com/) , Low-Cost Loggers, and Bicycle Measurements. 
The time-range of interest is: 26.06.19 18:00 until 27.06.19 13:00.

For the start, the focus lies only on NetAtmo data.

**Objective:**

1. Display relevant (meta-) information on-click of points.
2. Display these over a map.
3. Optional: *Animate* data / maps.

**Nice to have:**

- Visually appealing display of information
- Clickable paths (bicycle measurements)
- Further interactivity (Zoom / Mouse-Over / Interpolation with additional information)



**Time-Line**

- [x] Lecture weeks 01-07 - Lecture information and exercises 
- [x] (23.04) - Set-up project
- [x] (30.04) - Set-up data to be used
- [ ] (14.05) - Render points
- [ ] (28.05) - Implement clickable points with feedback
- [ ] (11.06) - Overlay points and pop-ups on map
- [ ] (25.06) - Implement way to navigate in set time-steps



**Project Requirements:**

- Python 3.X
